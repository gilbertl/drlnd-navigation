##Project Environment##

The Jupyter notebook in this repository trains an agent to navigate and collect bananas in a large, square world. The model has a state space input with 37 dimensions comprising velocity and ray-based perception of the world's objects.

The agent has four discrete actions: 0) move forward, 1) move backward, 2) turn left, and 3) turn right. We consider the environment solved when the agent has scored an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

##Instructions##

1. Follow the instructions in the [DRLND GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) to set up the Python experiment.
